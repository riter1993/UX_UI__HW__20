                Our team worked with the Minneapolis non-profit "Full Cycle" to help redesign their webpage in 
                order to break down the flow of information, as well as increase their donation engagement, all 
                while keeping responsive web design and accessibility at the forefront of the redesign.

                <h2>THE PROBLEM<span style="color: #df6427;">_</span></h2>
                <p> Full Cycle is a Twin Cities-based non-profit supporting housing-displaced youth through their 
                    passion for bicycles and repairs. We have observed that Full Cycleâ€™s website does not provide 
                    the user with enough information on where their donations are going.
                </p>

            <div class="container-sm" id="solution">
            <h2>THE SOLUTION<span style="color: #df6427;">_</span></h2>
                <p> We developed a responsive web page for Full Cycle that better connects the nonprofit to the 
                    community by putting their story front and center in hopes of increasing patronage and donations 
                    and to spread awareness of the homeless epidemic in Minneapolis.

                <h2>USER RESEARCH<span style="color: #df6427;">_</span></h2>
                <p> Research was conducted over the first week of the project duration. This was mainly done through 
                    interviews, both with Full Cycle administration and potential site users. We structured an affinity 
                    diagram using our interview findings.

                <img src="images/Affinity Diagram.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
                <p> After organizing our data into groups we found that people were emotionally motivated when choosing 
                    a charity to give to. They want to know the story of the organization and how their donations will 
                    positively affect the community. We also found that a lack of information about the organization or 
                    where their money is allocated is an inhibitor to donating.

                <div class="col-4">
                <p> A Google Survey was also built and circulated through the class and team member's various 
                    social medias. The survey brought in more quantitative data for us to work with. Most importantly we found 
                    that users, on average, donate $50 or more to a charity annually.

                    <p> We also found that 67.7% of people engage with a non-profit mainly through their website, confirming 
                        the need for a website redesign.
